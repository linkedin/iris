REST API
========

HMAC Auth
---------

API requests which require auth will have an extra :code:`AUTHORIZATION` HTTP header. It looks like
this:

.. code-block:: none

  AUTHORIZATION: hmac $application:$payload

:code:`$payload` is a base64 encoded hmac sha512 digest of the following string. In the resulting base64 string, instances of :code:`+` are replaced with :code:`-`
and :code:`/` are replaced with :code:`_`.

.. code-block:: none

  $window $httpMethod $path $body

:code:`$window` is the current unix timestamp in seconds, divided by 5, floor'd.

:code:`$httpMethod` is generally :code:`POST`

:code:`$path` is the path portion of the URL, such as :code:`/v0/incidents`

:code:`$body` is generally the json-formatted post body.
